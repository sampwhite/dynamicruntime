## Overview

Welcome to Dynamic Runtime, an open source project to create a flexible Java application that can scale in both
complexity and load. Go to the [Github Dynamic Runtime Project](https://github.com/sampwhite/dynamicruntime) for
more. For information about the **DnType** schema, see [Dynamic Types](/content/md/DynamicType.md). For some
thoughts on the code in this project see [Thoughts on Coding](/content/md/ThoughtsOnCode.md).

Some of the results of creating data sourced schema driven code can be seen at
